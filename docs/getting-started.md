# Getting Started

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://revyl.com/install.sh | sh
```

Or use a package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Homebrew (macOS)
brew install RevylAI/tap/revyl
```

```bash pipx (cross-platform)
pipx install revyl
```

```bash pip
pip install revyl
```

</CodeGroup>

## Set Up

```bash
revyl doctor                     # Check CLI version, auth, connectivity
revyl auth login                 # Authenticate with your API key
cd your-app && revyl init        # Detect framework, create .revyl/config.yaml
revyl skill install --force      # Install agent skills: dev-loop, create, auth-bypass
```

## Connect Your AI Coding Agent

Revyl skills are the recommended way to teach your AI coding agent how to use
the CLI well. During interactive `revyl init`, Revyl asks which AI coding tool
you use and installs the recommended skills for that tool automatically:

- **Cursor** installs to `.cursor/skills`
- **Codex** installs to `.codex/skills`
- **Claude Code** installs to `.claude/skills`
- **Skip for now** leaves setup for later

Project-level Cursor setup also installs `.cursor/rules/revyl-skills.mdc` so Cursor can route Revyl requests to the right skill. Codex and Claude Code use their native skill directories without mutating config files.

If you skipped that prompt or want to refresh skills after a CLI update, install
the recommended skill bundle:

```bash
revyl skill install --force
```

Install one skill when you want the agent focused on a specific job:

| Agent intent | Install | Prompt with |
|---|---|---|
| Run a generic Revyl dev loop, interact with the device, and verify app behavior | `revyl skill install --name revyl-cli-dev-loop --force` | `Use the revyl-cli-dev-loop skill.` |
| Author or refine stable Revyl YAML tests, then validate, push, run, and inspect reports | `revyl skill install --name revyl-cli-create --force` | `Use the revyl-cli-create skill.` |
| Set up test-only auth bypass across a mobile app stack | `revyl skill install --name revyl-cli-auth-bypass --force` | `Use the revyl-cli-auth-bypass skill.` |

Useful install variants:

```bash
revyl skill list                             # List first-class skills
revyl skill install --global --force        # Install skills for all projects
revyl skill install --cursor --force        # Force Cursor if auto-detect is ambiguous
revyl skill install --codex --force         # Force Codex if auto-detect is ambiguous
revyl skill install --claude --force        # Force Claude Code if auto-detect is ambiguous
revyl skill show --name revyl-cli-dev-loop  # Print a named skill to stdout
revyl skill show --name revyl-cli-auth-bypass
revyl skill export --name revyl-cli-create -o FILE
```

## Pick Your Path

| I want to... | Start here |
|---|---|
| Test an **Expo** app | [Expo Build Guide](builds/expo.md) |
| Test a **React Native** (bare) app | [React Native Build Guide](builds/react-native.md) |
| Test a **Flutter** app | [Flutter Build Guide](builds/flutter.md) |
| Test a native **iOS (Swift)** app | [iOS Build Guide](builds/ios-native.md) |
| Test a native **Android (Kotlin/Java)** app | [Android Build Guide](builds/android-native.md) |
| **Control a cloud device** (no app build) | [Device Quickstart](device/quickstart.md) |
| Set up **CI/CD** testing | [CI/CD Integration](ci-cd.md) |
| Install **AI agent skills** | [Agent Skills](integrations/skills.md) |
| Connect my **AI coding agent over MCP** | [MCP Setup](integrations/mcp-setup.md) |

Each build guide walks you through the exact 2-3 commands to go from your repo to a passing test.

## What Happens Next

After following your framework's build guide, your typical workflow is:

1. **Dev loop** -- `revyl dev` connects a cloud device to your local code with hot reload. See [Dev Loop](developer_loop/dev-loop.md).
2. **Create tests** -- write YAML test definitions and run them. See [Your First Test](tests/first-test.md).
3. **CI/CD** -- run tests on every PR. See [CI/CD Integration](ci-cd.md).

## Key Concepts

- **App** -- a named container for your uploaded builds (e.g. "My App iOS"). Tests run against an app.
- **Build** -- a simulator `.app` (iOS) or `.apk` (Android) uploaded to Revyl. Each upload is tagged with your git branch.
- **Test** -- a YAML file defining steps (tap, type, validate) that run on a cloud device against your build.
- **Workflow** -- a named collection of tests that run together (e.g. "smoke-tests").
- **Device session** -- a cloud-hosted iOS or Android device you can control via CLI, SDK, or MCP.
