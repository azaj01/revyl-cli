# Revyl CLI

AI-powered mobile testing from your terminal. Create, run, and manage end-to-end tests for iOS and Android apps without leaving your development environment.

Full web dashboard docs at [docs.revyl.ai](https://docs.revyl.ai).

## Getting Started

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
curl -fsSL https://revyl.com/install.sh | sh

# 2. Check your environment
revyl doctor

# 3. Authenticate
revyl auth login

# 4. Initialize your project
cd your-app && revyl init

# 5. Install agent skills
# Available: revyl-cli-dev-loop (dev loop), revyl-cli-create (test authoring)
revyl skill install --force

# 6. Build and upload
revyl build upload

# 7. Start the dev loop
revyl dev

## Build Guides

Framework-specific guides to go from repo to test results in 3 commands.

- [Expo](builds/expo.md) — local build or EAS cloud, two commands to test
- [React Native (bare)](builds/react-native.md) — xcodebuild / Gradle, then upload
- [Flutter](builds/flutter.md) — flutter build, then upload
- [iOS Native (Swift)](builds/ios-native.md) — xcodebuild for simulator, or auto-detect from DerivedData
- [Android Native (Kotlin/Java)](builds/android-native.md) — Gradle assembleDebug, then upload
- [Artifact Requirements](builds/artifact-requirements.md) — what your `.app` / `.apk` must look like
- [Building in CI](builds/ci-builds.md) — `--url` uploads, GitHub Action, EAS cloud patterns

## Developer Loop

- [Dev Loop](developer_loop/dev-loop.md) — `revyl dev` with hot reload, device interaction, test creation
